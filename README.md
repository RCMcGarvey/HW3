# Project 3

## Runing
  Clone the repo we are assuming that you are using IntelliJ. If you open the project in intellij you should be ale to run the program right off the bat. If not you might have to create a new run config. To do that in IntelliJ go up to the top menu bar. Next to the hammer there should be an option to select "add a new configuration". Do this then there should be a plus button in ther top left corner of a new window. Hit that select application config and set  the running class to Main.java. Apply the changes and it should allow you to run the program.
  
## Problems Encountered
  Started a little late. Oops
  Figuring oput how to run everything especially taking orders.
  
## Assumptions
  That basic unit tests are fine.
  That users have IntelliJ
